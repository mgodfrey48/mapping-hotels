# python-api-challenge
This repo contains all files and code for the Python API HW for Northwestern's Data Science and Visualization Bootcamp.

In this assignment I used OpenWeather's API to gather weather and location data. I then generated a heatmap of the the data and identified areas in the world that match specific climate/weather criteria. Finally, I used Google's geocoding API to find hotels in those locations and plot them on the heatmap.
